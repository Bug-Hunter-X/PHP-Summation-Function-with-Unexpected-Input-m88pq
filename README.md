# PHP Summation Function with Unexpected Input
This repository demonstrates a common error in PHP: unexpected behavior when performing arithmetic operations on an array containing non-numeric values. The `calculateSum` function aims to sum numbers in an array. However, it fails to handle non-numeric inputs gracefully, leading to incorrect results. This example highlights the importance of input validation in PHP functions to avoid unexpected behavior and ensure data integrity. The solution demonstrates how to improve the function by adding input validation to handle only numeric values.
